# Alzheimers_Disease_PredictionI_Using_MRI_Data
A deep learning system to classify Alzheimer's disease from T1-weighted MRI scans. Conducted a reproducible comparative analysis of VGG-16, ResNet-50, and Inception-ResNet-v2 on a balanced, augmented dataset of 44,000 images across four classes. The VGG-16 model achieved the highest performance with 97.9% accuracy and a 0.979 macro-F1 score.
