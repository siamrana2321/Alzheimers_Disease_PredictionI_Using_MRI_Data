This dataset is intended for use in machine learning model training and testing. All images are skull-stripped and clean of non-brain tissue.\n\nDataset Structure\nThe dataset is organized into the following four directories, each representing a different class of disease severity:\nNonDemented: Contains 12,800 MRI images of subjects with no signs of dementia.\nVeryMildDemented: Contains 11,200 MRI images of subjects with very mild symptoms of dementia.\nMildDemented: Contains 10,000 MRI images of subjects with mild dementia.\nModerateDemented: Contains 10,000 MRI images of subjects with moderate dementia.\n\nImage Details\nTotal Number of Images: 44,000\nImage Format: MRI scans as .JPG files\nImage Usage: Suitable for training and testing machine learning models focused on classifying Alzheimer\u0027s disease stages.\n\nDisease Severity Classification\nThe dataset follows a severity ranking system for Alzheimer\u0027s disease:\nNonDemented: No dementia.\nVery Mild Demented: Early signs of dementia, very mild symptoms.\nMild Demented: Clear signs of dementia, but still mild.\nModerate Demented: More pronounced symptoms of dementia, moderate severity.\n\nThis dataset is an augmented and upsampled version of the dataset below:\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uraninjo/augmented-alzheimer-mri-dataset-v2\n\nThis dataset was upsampled as the original dataset had a large class imbalance."}
